//  In this article, we will learn how to create a grid of statistics using the  StatsGrid  widget in a Flutter application. We will also learn how to create a  StatCard  widget to display a statistic in a card format.
//  The  StatsGrid  widget is a  StatelessWidget  that displays a grid of  StatCard  widgets. The  StatsGrid  widget is used in the  AdminDashboard  widget to display the statistics of the admin dashboard. 
//  The  StatsGrid  widget is a  GridView.count  widget with a  crossAxisCount  of 2, which means that it will display two columns of  StatCard  widgets. The  StatsGrid  widget has a  shrinkWrap  property set to  true  and a  physics  property set to  NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()  to prevent the grid from scrolling. 
//  The  StatsGrid  widget has four  StatCard  widgets, each displaying a different statistic. The  StatCard  widget displays the title, value, icon, and color of the statistic. 
//  The  StatsGrid  widget is used in the  AdminDashboard  widget to display the statistics of the admin dashboard.

//  In this release, they have got multiple performance improvements in the Dart language. A new improvement is to reduce the app size in the release versions of the app. Another performance improvement is to reduce junk in the display of app animation by using the warm-up phase. 
//  If your app is junk information during the first run then the  Skia Shading Language shader provides for pre-compilation as part of your app’s build. This can speed it up by more than 2x. 
//  Added a better support of mouse cursors for web and desktop flutter app,. Now many widgets will show cursor on top of them or you can specify the type of supported cursor you want. 
//  Autofill for mobile text fields

//  Flutter means flying wings quickly, and lightly but obviously, this doesn’t apply in our SDK. 
//  So
// Why Flutter?
 
//  Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to write an app in one codebase and compile to both  Android and iOS. 
//  This allows you to run the same code on both platforms without having to write different code. 
//  Flutter provides  hot reload , which allows you to see the result of your work instantly. 
//  How Flutter works? 
//  Flutter uses  Dart  as the programming language. 
//  Dart is a modern, statically typed programming language. 
//  It is AOT (Ahead Of Time) compiled to fast machine code for lightning-fast performance. 
//  The  Flutter UI Framework  allows you to build  UI  easily, and you have a  lot of premade widgets .
